Welcome to RTNeuron, the scalable real-time rendering tool for the
visualization of neuronal simulations based on cable models.

The main utility of RTNeuron is twofold: the interactive visual inspection of
structural and functional features of the cortical column model and the
generation of high quality movies and images for presentation and publications.
This guide will get you acquaintanced with all the features provided by
RTNeuront and how to fully exploit them for both purposes.

RTNeuron provides a C++ library with the rendering backend, a Python wrapping
and an Python application called \c rtneuron.  This documentation mostly
covers the use of the command line application and the Python wrapping. To use
RTNeuron as a C++ library, developers are referred to the C++ class reference.

The user documentation of RTNeuron is comprised by the following sections:
- \subpage user_guide, concepts, basics, and command line usage.
- \subpage reference_manual, all command line options and class documentation.
- The <a href="python/index.html">Python module</a> reference.
- The <a href="python/gallery.html">The code example and image gallery</a>.
- \subpage release_notes.

There are several online resources available which may be of interest to
users:
- The <a href=https://github.com/BlueBrain/RTNeuron>github repository</a>.
- The online copy of <a href=https://developer.humanbrainproject.eu/docs/projects/RTNeuron/@PROJECT_VERSION@/index.html>this documentation</a>.

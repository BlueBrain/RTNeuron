# Introduction

# New in this release

## New Features

- Added a new command line application called morphology-collage to generate
  collections of images to show the positioning of morphology type instances in
  relation to layer/region boundaries.
- New button in the connectivity browser to hide/show the neurons connected
  to a cell when only a pre/post synaptic cell has been picked.

## Enhancements

- When built without CUDA support or run with the --no-cuda option, branch
  level clipping and no axon display modes are now also available.
- Model size hint calculation improved. This improves the appearance when
  switching from perspective to orthographic projection.

## API Changes

- New function Scene::getClipPlane to query the equation of a clipping plane
  previously set.

## CLI Changes

- The --target command line option now accepts a %percentage suffix after target
  names to reduce the target size to a given fraction randomly sampled.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed lost scene operations when applied before the internal scene
  representation is created.
- Consider the second axon section instead of the first one for unreported
  actions sections in simulation mapping.

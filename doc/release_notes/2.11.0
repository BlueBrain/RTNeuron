# Introduction

# New in this release

## Enhancements

- The browse_connection demo now also displays the synapses when a single
  cell has been picked. The second cell can be selected by clicking on a
  synapse and filtering based on selections on the legend also works for
  synapses.
- Camera manipulation is now possible using the cursor keys together with Ctrl
  and Shift.
- Network communication changed to use the new HBP/BBP ZeroBuf vocabulary
  (project Lexis).

## API Changes

- The SelectionBroker class has been removed.
- Removed deprecated overloads of Camera::setProjectionFrustum and
  Camera::setProjectionOrtho.

## CLI Changes

- All the options related to the bucket depth peeling algorithm have been
  removed.
- The option --alpha-blending now chooses the best algorithm available if
  no additional parameter is given.
- New command line option --alpha-aware. This option enables alpha accumulation
  related optimizations as supported by the alpha-blending algorithm chosen.
  Not enabled by default because its efficacy is use case dependent.

## Documentation

- Added some IPython notebooks to the documentation to replace the old
  Python tutorial.

## Bug Fixes

- The combination of --no-morpologies and soma only visualization was crashing
  when simulation data was displayed.
- [BBPRTN-533](https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/BBPRTN-533):
  In some cases synapse sets were not inmediately displayed after adding them
  to the scene when there were already some synapses present.

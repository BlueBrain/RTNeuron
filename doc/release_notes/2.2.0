# Introduction

This release adds several features to the creation and modification of
scenes. The most important is the implementation of synapse targets in
rtneuron-app.py, this is not exposed to the command line yet (only
interactive shell and Python/C++ API), however it improves over the
previous implementation in two important ways:
- Synapses targets are not anymore tied to neurons.
- A synapse target can be changed in size and color at any time.

Apart from synapses now it is possible to add polygonal models loaded
from files or created programmatically by the user as triangle meshes.

Several bugs have also been fixed, prominently several affecting the use
of RTNeuron as a Python module embedded in other applications.

# New in this release

## New Features
- Now its possible to assign a different color to the axon and dendrites
  of different targets when using by-branch coloring mode. (
  <a href=https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/BBPRTN-115>
   BBPRTN-115</a>).
- Adapted to support new triangle strips produced by NeuMesh (which
  correct the triangle winding). Old strips are supported by versioning
  of the mesh files.
- Addition and modification of synapse targets to the scene. Once a
  synapse target is added, it's possible to change its color and radius.
- Addition of model files loadable by OpenSceneGraph plugins to the scene.
- Addition of arbitrary polygonal meshes to the scene given as triangle
  soups (<a href=https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/BBPRTN-103>
  BBPRTN-103</a>)

## API Changes
- Added a new signal to RTNeuron triggered.
- Added functions to Scene to include synapses and polygonal models to
  the scene
- In the Python side added the functions display_synapses and
  display_shared_synapses to ease the addition of synapse targets.

## Command line interface changes
- Added to optional parameters to by-branch coloring mode
- --soma-radius option implemented in rtneuron-app.py
(<a href=https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/BBPRTN-104>

## Deprecation Deprecation and dropped support
- Last release including rtneuron.osgviewer (now for real)

## Documentation
- TODO (update documentation with new features)

## Bug Fixes
- <a href=https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/BBPRTN-58>
  BBPRTN-58</a>: Occlusion of text labels by neurons.
- <a href=https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/BBPRTN-108>
  BBPRTN-108</a>.
- <a href=https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/BBPRTN-110>
  BBPRTN-113</a>: Initialization problems of rtneuron Python module when
  importing from an interactive Python shell.
- The local scope of the IPython shell is now the global scope. This
  fixes the undefined name errors inside callback functions that are
  declared in the shell and invoked by the engine..
- Fixed some bugs on scene management and view frustum culling
  triggerred by display_circuit and scene updates.
- <a href=https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/BBPRTN-121>
  BBPRTN-121</a> and
  <a href=https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/BBPRTN-122>
  BBPRTN-122</a>, crashes at exit.

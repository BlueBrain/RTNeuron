# Introduction

# New in this release

## New Features

- Added a new expandable menu in the circuit viewer app for additional
  settings. The only setting at the moment is the background color.

## Optimizations

- Performance improvements when loading circuits in soma only mode with no
  morphologies.

## Bug fixes

- When loading large circuits, the progress indicator in the loader GUI seemed
  to freeze due to some erroneous logic.

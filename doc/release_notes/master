# Introduction

This is major release that introduces a new API resulting from the transition
from BBPSDK to Brion/Brain as the data access layer.

No new features are provided by this release.

# New in this release

## API Changes

- All deprecated functions, variables and types have been removed.
- The addNeurons, addAfferentSynapses and addEfferentSynapses methods have
  been changed to take GIDSets (lists or numpy arrays of ints in the Python
  side) and brain::Synapses as input.
- The objects returned by Scene::Object::getObject have been changed according
  to the new inputs taken by the *add* methods.
- All Scene methods taking bpp::Cell_Target now take brion::GIDSet. These
  methods accept iterables or numpy arrays in the Python side.
- All Scene methods taking Synapse or Synapses objects now take brain::Synapse
  and brain::Synapses.
- Public enums changed to be C++11 enum classes. The bbp::rtneuron::types
  namespace has been removed.
- The scene attribute conservative_loading has been removed.
- Added the scene attribute 'circuit', string with the URI of the circuit to
  display. This attribute is only taken be the  constructor.
- Added the methods Scene::getCircuit and Scene::setCircuit.
- Added the scene attribute mesh_path. This attribute allows the user to
  set the path to a directory containing neuron meshes. Intended for future
  use with SONATA circuits.
- Added two new methods to NeuronClipping, unclipEfferentBranches and
  unlcipAfferentBranches. This methods take into C++ some compute intensive
  code that was called from rtneuron.sceneops.SynapticProjections.
- Scene::ModelSelected signal removed as it was not triggered from anywhere.
- rtneuron Python module variables 'experiment' and 'app' renamed to
  'simulation' and 'engine'.

Changes in the Python API

## CLI Changes

- The python application rtneuron-app.py has been renamed to rtneuron.
- The option --demo has been renamed to --app.
- Two power apps have been renamed: browse_connections to connection_viewer
  and circuit_slicing to circuit_viewer.

## Deprecation

- Two applications have been renamed: circuit_slicing is now circuit_viewer
  and browse_connections is connection_viewer.

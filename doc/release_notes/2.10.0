# Introduction

# New in this release

## New Features

- Added a new demo/power app, called browse_connections, to analyze synaptic
  pairs. This application allows the user to pick pre and post-synaptic cells
  on a scene by clicking on their somas or typing their GIDs. Cells can be
  additionally colorized and filtered by metype to facilitate selection.
- The color maps applied by the "color by distance to soma" and "color by width"
  coloring schemes are now configurable. The custom colormaps can be provided
  in te \c colormaps attribute of the neuron handler.
- Synapes are now selectable with the mouse. For the moment only single synapse
  selections are possible.

## Enhancements

- Adaptations to new ZeroEQ auto-connection style using session filtering.
- When the DB decomposition is not used, new objects can be added to a scene
  without having to rebuild the whole scene to update it. When objects are
  removed the scene still needs to be recreated from scratch.

## CLI Changes

- The options --sync-selections and --sync-camera now take an optional
  argument with the ZeroEq session name.
- The coloring mode alpha-by-width has been renamed to by-width
- The coloring mode alpha-by-distance-to-soma has been renamed to
  by-distance-to-soma
- --demo help now prints the list of available demos.

## API Changes

- Added new constructors to CameraBroker and SceneEventBroker to take a
  ZeroEQ session as input or use the default session.
- ALPHA_BY_WIDTH_COLORS renamed to BY_WIDTH_COLORS and
  ALPHA_BY_DISTANCE_TO_SOMA_COLORS renamed to BY_DISTANCE_TO_SOMA (the Python
  wrapping names have been renamed accordingly).
- New attributes for neuron object handlers: \c colormaps.by_distance_to_soma
  and \c colormaps.by_width
- Added the function \c rtneuron.snapshot_to_notebook to use inside a IPython
  notebook to capture a snapshot and display it in the client browser.
- New signal Scene::synapseSelected emitted when a synapse is hit by the pick
  method.
- Added the function \c rtneuron.display_empty_scene to the Python module.
- New functions \c colorize_scene_with_targets and
  \c colorize_neurons_with_targets in \c rtneuron.sceneops. These functions
  can be used to colorize the neurons of a scene according to key-color pairs.

## Bug fixes

- [22351](https://bbpcode.epfl.ch/code/#/c/22351) Mouse wheel events now also
  work with Qt GUIs.
- [21973](https://bbpcode.epfl.ch/code/#/c/21973) Representation mode upgrades
  from NO_DISPLAY to something else were not working.
- [20704](https://bbpcode.epfl.ch/code/#/c/20704/) Applying compartment data
  after having applied spike data was not updating properly the simulation
  buffer offsets for somas.
- [21445](https://bbpcode.epfl.ch/code/#/c/21445/) Fixed a special case of
  representation mode upgrade from soma to whole neuron. The soma was not
  displayed if a transition from soma to no display was made before the
  upgrade.

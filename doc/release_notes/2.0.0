# New in this release

## New Features
- Python wrapping of equalizer based library
- New python based application replaces rtneuron.equalizer
- Idle antialiasing and subpixel compounds.
- Frustum queries (only in rtneuron.osgviewer)
- Snapshot function that considers idle antialiasing.

## Enhancements
- Head tracking support reported to the console when no available and
  --tracker is used.
- Now all VRPN devices (spacemouse, wiimote and head tracking can be
  specified from the command line).
- More predictable output for movie recording.

## Optimizations

## Examples Examples

## Tools Tools

## API Changes

## Command line interface changes

- New options for target coloring are provided in rtneuron-app.py
- Some options available in rtneuron.osgviewer are still missing in the
  new application.

## Deprecation/dropped support

- The binary application rtneuron.osgviewer has been deprecated in
favour of Equalizer-based Python library. New features won't be
developed for this binary.
- All BBP-SDK pipeline code has been removed
- Stereo support in rtneuron.osgviewer has been degraded in favour of
  better support for Equalizer. Single eye per camera is the only mode
  guaranteed to work.

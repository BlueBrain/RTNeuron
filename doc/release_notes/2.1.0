# Introduction

This release is a refinement and consolidation of the rendering library
and Python wrapping of it first introduced in version 2.0.

The main features still missing in the new core library are:
- Addition of synapses, arbitrary models loadable by OSG and user
  given polygonal meshes
- mouse interaction.
- 2D GUI (easily workaroundable with the Python shell).

This is the last relase in which \c rtneuron.osgviewer will be included.
The rational behind this decision is to provide a simplification of the
core architecture.

# New in this release

## Command line interface changes

- Synapse display options inside neuron targets are now ignored.
- 'mesh' representation mode has been renamed to 'detailed' and
  'neurolucida' representation mode has been renamed to 'skeleton'.
  All namings are still supported but deprecated.
- Added a new option to not load morphologies is possible
  (--no-morphologies). Useful for soma only visualization of circuits
  with unique morphologies.

## Deprecation/dropped support

- Last release including rtneuron.osgviewer
- Removed pre Collage 0.8.0 and pre Equalizer 1.5.0 code

## Bug Fixes

- All non Jira tickets from release 2.0.0 have been addressed (?)

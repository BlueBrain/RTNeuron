# Introduction

This is a feature and bugfix release that introduces important
new features and in combination with recent updates in Collage and Equalizer
improves notably the reliability of the application when running in
distributed mode.

# New in this release

## New Features
- <a href=https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/BBPRTN-313>
  BBPRTN-313</a>: Consider the alpha channel of the background for frame
  capturing.
- <a href=https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/BBPRTN-314>
  BBPRTN-314</a>: A new representation mode for neuron targets to not
  display the axon of cells.
- Added an optional parameter to util.camera.Path.make_*_view to adjust
  the camera position using dendrites instead of somas.
- Added a scene attribute to choose not to connect first order branches
  to the soma (either the spherical or the detailed one).
- Removed multiprocess DB flag from the default Equalizer configuration
  parameters. This feature is now controlled by \c --eq-config-flags.
- Added three new profiling options:
  - 'readback' to skip frame readback.
  - 'compositing' to skip frame assembly.
  - 'channels' to profile and log per channel operations.
  .
- Added a free function to the Python console to display morphologies
  directly from their .h5 file. The function is called
   \c display_morphology_file, it creates a temporary circuit config to
   load the morphology and display the morphological segments using
   a tubelet model.
- SpikeData moved to BBPSDK. A new option, \c --show-spikes, has been added
  to show the spikes from the file pointed out by the BlueConfig.
- <a href=https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/BBPRTN-333>
  BBPRTN-333</a>: A method to dynamically adjust neuron thickness to all
  neurons inside a scene.
- Added a REST interface which can be enabled with \c --rest host|IP:port,
  which accepts PUT for CAMERA and REQUEST and exposes GET for HEARTBEAT,
  IMAGEJPEG and VOCABULARY, according to ZeroEQ event definitions and the
  corresponding vocabularies.

## API Changes
- Added two new attributes to control neuron surface inflation in a scene.
  - \c inflatable_neurons added to Scene attributes to enable the feature.
  - \c inflation_factor added to View attributes to set the absolute offset.
- Added new class RestInterface which setups RESTBridge and the according
  ZeroEQ subscriber and publisher to provide a REST interface to RTNeuron.

## Bug Fixes
- <a href=https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/BBPRTN-362>
  BBPRTN-362</a>: Correct compositing in DB direct send configurations.
- <a href=https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/BBPRTN-363>
  BBPRTN-363</a>: Fixed a bug in culling with DB decompositions and
  unique morphologies.
- Fixed several CUDA related crashes at exit.
- Fixed a crash at exit related to the deallocation of boost::shared_ptr
  created by Python without acquiring the GIL.
- Correct simulation display in OSG >= 3.2.
- Fixed several bugs in cell picking.

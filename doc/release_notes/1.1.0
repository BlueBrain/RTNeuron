# Introduction

## Features
  - The latest release of RTNeuron provides the following major
    features and improvements:
    - User guide and references embedded in the doxygen documentation.
    - Removal of Queued objects in preparation to dash adaption.
    - Round-robin DB decomposition for sort-last rendering
    - K-d tree based DB decomposition for sort-last rendering
    - Deferred data loading in Equalizer.

# New in this release

## New Features
  - Round robin and k-d tree based decompositions for sort-last
    parallel rendering.
    There are some limitations as described below.

## Documentation
  - New user guide included as part of the Doxygen documentation.

## Optimizations
  - All time multiplexing buffering using Queued objects has been removed.
    This is not an optimization but a step towards the development of a
    use case for dash.
  - Deferred data loading in the Equalizer build. Now, all nodes load
    the data during the frame start of the second frame, after all
    channels have annotated the DB ranges they need.

## Bug Fixes
  - LOD selection is now consistent across channels as long as the final
    segment is planar.

## Known Bugs
  - In the Equalizer version some parallel rendering modes are
    incompatible with stereo.
  - DB decompositions only works with a single channel per node (there is
    only one scene per node). For multi-GPU machines a node per GPU is
    required. Although not trivial, it is possible to allow multiple
    channels per node, each one with its own scene range, this may be
    allowed in future versions.
  - In DB composition, switching from a camera path to the trackball
    manipulator and then pressing space does not produce a consistent
    home position in all nodes.

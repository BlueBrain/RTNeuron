# New in this release

## New Features
- Loading of .bin mesh files without circuit (<a href="https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/BBPRTN-52">BBPRTN-52</a>)
- Frame grabbing implemented in the Equalizer version.
- Code adapted to new BBP-SDK report class.
- Spatial partition is the new default mode for DB compounds in the
  Equalizer version.

## Enhancements
- DB decompositions now support batches of targets with different
  attributes. This allows, among other things, loading a collection of
  targets with different colors from the command line.
- Removed pre-1.2 Equalizer code.

## Bug Fixes
- <a href="https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/BBPRTN-48">
BBPRTN-48: Multilayer depth peeling doesn't render anything with latest
NVIDIA driver on Linux.</a>
- Fix a regression with colormap rendering in the GUI

## Known Bugs
- All Jira tickets :) plus
  - In the Equalizer version some parallel rendering modes are
    incompatible with stereo.
  - DB decompositions only works with a single channel per node (there is
    only one scene per node). For multi-GPU machines a node per GPU is
    required. Although not trivial, it is possible to allow multiple
    channels per node, each one with its own scene range, this may be
    allowed in future versions.
  - In DB composition, switching from a camera path to the trackball
    manipulator and then pressing space does not produce a consistent
    home position in all nodes.

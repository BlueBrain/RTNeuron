# Introduction

## Features Features

This release is a transition release between 1.2.1 and the new version
which will be based on a C++ code wrapped in Python.

Apart from several bugfixes, the most remarkable changes are that
support of BlueHub has been dropped and the code has been ported to
OpenSceneGraph 3.0.1.

# New in this release

## New Features
- SpaceMouse and Wiimote support for navigation in Equalizer.

## Enhancements
- The code has been adapted to OSG 3.0.1. Support from previous OSG
versions has been dropped
- Transparency rendering has been factored out as a standalone project
  (see <a href=https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/spaces/display/OSGTR/OSG+Transparency+-+Portal>OSG Transparency</a>)
- BlueHub support has been dropped.
- The build system now uses the scripts from common/CMake.
- Improved stability in multinode Equalizer configuration.

## Command line interface changes
- Option --window has been renamed to --sim-window

## Bug Fixes
- Draw serialization bug in multi-threaded Equalizer configurations.
- Spatial DB decompositions were broken (neurons could be missed).
- <a href=https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/BBPRTN-37>
  BBPRTN-37</a> Incorrect kd-tree partition if there are multiple targets
  with different attributes (e.g. color)
- <a href=https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/BBPRTN-56>
  BBPRTN-56</a> Deadlock at startup of rtneuron.equalizer when simulation
  is enabled and --no-gui is used.</a>
- <a href=https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/BBPRTN-60>
  BBPRTN-60</a> Spike rendering broken for spherical somas in current master
- <a href=https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/BBPRTN-67>
  BBPRTN-67</a> Octree-based view frustum culling not working with
  DB decompositions
- Hotfix for <a href=https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/BBPRTN-31>
  BBPRTN-31</a> rtneuron.equalizer deadlocks when switching on Eq
  statistics.

## Known Bugs
- Jira Tickets
- In the Equalizer version some parallel rendering modes are
  incompatible with stereo.
- DB decompositions only works with a single channel per node (there is
  only one scene per node). For multi-GPU machines a node per GPU is
  required.
- In DB composition, switching from a camera path to the trackball
  manipulator and then pressing space does not produce a consistent
  home position in all nodes.

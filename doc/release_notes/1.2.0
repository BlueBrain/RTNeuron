# Introduction

## Features
- The major features and improvements of RTNeuron 1.2.0 are:
    - RPM packages for RHEL6.1 and debs for Ubuntu 11.10 are now provided.
    Previous Ubuntun 11.04 package is also maintained.
    - Now it is possible to build all artifacts from a single CMake
    configuration.
    - The minimum Equalizer version supported is now 1.2.0 and the minimum
    CUDA version is 4.0.
    - The performance of the culling algorithm has been improved based on
    the adoption of CUDA 4.0. In the parallel version now each channel
    uses the same GPU for rendering and culling (the GPU selection is
    based on the screen number)

# New in this release

## Enhancements
- Multiple CUDA devices now supported for CUDA-based culling. This only
has effect in the Equalizer version of the tool.

## Optimizations
- Dispatching of view frustum culling CUDA kernels improved thanks to the
adoption of CUDA 4.0. The overhead introduced by the global thread used
for dispatching has been eliminated.
- Early frame assembly implemented as dicussed in <a href="/project/issues/browse/BBPRTN-41">here</a>

## Bug Fixes
  - Tile generator for Producer config files fixed (now using a more proper configuration syntax).
  - Fixed the install RPATH

  BBPRTN-35: Simulation playback broken</a>
  - <a href="https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/BBPRTN-33">
  BBPRTN-33: Spatial DB only shows one brick in the dest channel</a>
  - <a href="https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/BBPRTN-44">
  BBPRTN-44: New culling code causes &#39;invalid value&#39; OpenGL errors when LODs are used.</a>

## Known Bugs
- All Jira tickets :) plus
  - In the Equalizer version some parallel rendering modes are
    incompatible with stereo.
  - DB decompositions only works with a single channel per node (there is
    only one scene per node). For multi-GPU machines a node per GPU is
    required. Although not trivial, it is possible to allow multiple
    channels per node, each one with its own scene range, this may be
    allowed in future versions.
  - In DB composition, switching from a camera path to the trackball
    manipulator and then pressing space does not produce a consistent
    home position in all nodes.
